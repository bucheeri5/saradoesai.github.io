In particular, we will explore the [**Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julian3833/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). This challenge brought to light bias in the data that sparked the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification). \n",

Biases can creep in at any stage of the AI task, from data collection methods, how we split/organise the test set, different algorithms, how the results are interpreted and deployed. Some of these topics have been extensively discussed and as a response, Kaggle has developed a course on AI ethics:\n",

    "1. The biases discussed are historical bias, representation bias, measurement bias, aggregation bias, evaluation bias, deployment bias. I was familiar with representation bias, as a lot of sampling methods aim to address that in the early stages. Other types of relevant biases include confirmation bias- especially with supervised learning that may require human review before any action is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Kaggle tutorial on bias in AI systems demonstrated how even datasets can contain hidden biases. The tutorial analysed a dataset of toxic and non-toxic comments, using linear regression to classify the comments into one of two categories; toxic and non-toxic. Upon closer inspection, it became apparent that certain words were associated with toxicity, such as \"Muslim\" and \"Black,\" while others, like \"white\" and \"Christian,\" were deemed non-toxic. This classification reinforced harmful stereotypes and biases, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the data used to train AI systems. The tutorial showed how AI systems can perpetuate existing social inequalities. By understanding these biases, developers can take steps to mitigate them and create more inclusive technologies."

    "1. The fact that words like \"apple,\" \"juice,\" \"fruit,\" and \"wine\" are close together in the language model's vector space suggests that the model has learned to associate certain words with particular concepts or categories. This is referred to as semantic bias, and it can be a desirable property in certain applications, such as natural language processing or text classification. However, it can potenitally also lead to biases in the model's predictions, particularly if the training data contains culturally-loaded language. \n",

The association of words like \"Sir\" and \"Walter\" with \"engineer\" and \"Nurse\" with \"daughter\" and \"Rebecca\" suggests that the language model has learned to associate certain words with particular professions or demographics. This is known as stereotyping, and it can be a source of bias in AI systems. Stereotypes can lead to inaccurate predictions and perpetuate harmful societal norms, particularly if they are based on incomplete or outdated information. For example, if a language model is trained on a dataset that contains mostly male engineers, it may have difficulty generating female engineers or associating engineering with women. Similarly, if the dataset has nurse as mainly women, it might be challenging to associate the pattern of male nurses.\n",

The discussions in this notebook were interesting esepcially when I consdiered it in alignment with the lecture on banking. The guest lecturer was talking about detecting fraud and such. This got me thinking about how this translates in practice, because this model was clearly unfair towards one group in comparison to results to the other.

    "In this section we will explore the reasons behind decisions that AI makes. While this is really hard to know, there are some approaches developed to know which features in your data (e.g. median_income in the housing dataset we used before) played a more important role than others in determining how your machine learning model performs. One of the many approaches for assessing feature importance is **permutation importance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind permutation importance is simple. Features are what you might consider the columns in a tabulated dataset, such as that might be found in a spreadsheet. \n",
    "- The idea of permutation importance is that a feature is important if the performance of your AI program gets messed up by **shuffling** or **permuting** the order of values in that feature column for the entries in your test data. \n",

    "2. The results from the exercise are not surprising, however, I expected longitude and longitude to have approximately the same values; they did not, and this could be due to multiple reasons as discussed in my notebook.\n",
    "3. Permutation importance is a valuable tool for debugging, understanding your model, and communicating a high-level overview of your model's behaviour. However, it's important to note that permutation importance is dependent on model error, and therefore cannot be relied upon in cases where we do not have access to the true outcome data. Features must be uncorrelated for permutation importance to be accurate, which can be challenging to achieve in real-world problems where features are often correlated. The number of permutations used in the computation of feature importance can impact the accuracy of the results, with few permutations potentially leading to false or inaccurate results, while too many permutations can result in lengthy processing times.\n",
    "5. There are several ways to address the issues related to permutation importance in machine learning, and three of the most appropriate ways are: using appropriate evaluation metrics, addressing correlation between features, and using a larger sample size. Using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error or cross-validation which has ave been employed in my previous notebook, can help to provide a more robust and reliable assessment of feature importance. Addressing correlation between features can help to mitigate the impact of correlated features and provide a more accurate assessment of feature importance. Increasing the sample size can also help to reduce the variability in permutation importance estimates and improve the reliability of the results.\n",
