We used different libraries, such as ipython and matplotlib to do that. during the process, we have altered an image by converting it into an array and then altering the brightness. All of this was done mathematically! Perhaps this show that we need to move away from seperating discplines and seeing the beauty and the potential of merging our skills, whether it is in the arts and humanities or STEM."
